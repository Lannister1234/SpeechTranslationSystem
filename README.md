# SpeechTranslationSystem
This project is to train an attention-based end-to-end speech-to-text Deep Neural Network. 
The inputs are utterances and their corresponding transcripts. It uses a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
and Dense Networks to implement a system for speech to text transcription. The system is able to transcribe a given speech utterance to its corresponding transcript.
